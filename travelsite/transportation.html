        <p1> New Zealand and Auckland in particular features general transportation such as Buses, trains, and boatrides. However, New Zealand is a beautiful country, so many tourists prefer to walk around in cities and different areas. There is public transportation for anyone who needs it, so if you need to get around, just find the nearest bus or train station> </p1>
