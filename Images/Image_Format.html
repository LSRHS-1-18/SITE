        <p>PNG: PNG offers two different types of image, PNG-8 and PNG-24. PNG-8 shares many features with a GIF, as you can choose colors for your image, with a maximum of 256 colors. It is not as clear an image as PNG-24. PNG-24 allows for a much better quality image, however the size has less range than other file types.
        <p>JPG: JPGs are the best way to work with an image containing more complicated elements, like shadows. By using the "Quality" slider, you can adjust how clear your image is, and the size of your image when saved as a JPG.
        <p>GIF: GIFs have a low file size, making them more popular in graphics. Can use only 256 colors, which makes it harder to get a real life matching quality. Even when using the maximum number of colors, GIFs are unable to show the precise quality that a JPG can offer.
