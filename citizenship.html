      <h3>Elements of Citizenship</h3>
        <p>1. Honesty: to tell the truth when asked and to honor rules and codes, use integrity in all situations. - honesty is important because a good citizen must tell the truth. Whether they are talking to someone in charge or a peer, honesty must be used at all times.
        <p>2. Compassion: to have a sense of what another person is feeling, and to use empathy in order to understand situations. - compassion is important because a good citizen must feel empathy for their fellow citizens, and provide help or support when they are in need of it. Without compassion, citizens may not understand how other citizens feel about certain topics, creating possible conflicts between them.
        <p>3. Respect: to follow rules and guidlines, and to treat other citizens well. To pay attention to what people need, and not to disrupt or break belongings of other citizens. - respect is important because a good citizen must respect their peers and people who are in charge. Citizens must respect others' property and opinions, as well as obtaining a general sense of respect for all other citizens. Without respect for these three things, there would be conflict and tension between citizens, something that is not wanted.
        <p>4. Responsibility: to acknowledge your own mistakes, and to come forward if you have done something wrong. to step up and help others, do your fair share to keep a Civilization running. - responsibility is important because a good citizen must take responsibility for their actions, as well as step up and take on responsibility in order to help other citizens. Each citizen must take on responsibility at some time in order for the society to work well.
        <p>5. Courage: to be brave during times of struggle, and to be able to share your feelings, and stand up to others when they are doing something mean or wrong. - courage is important because a good citizen must have courage to act and courage to take charge in situations of chaos. A citizen needs the courage to stand up for others if they are being hurt, and the courage to get help for themselves or someone else if it is needed. The courage to put ideas on the line is necessary for a good civilian as well.
      <h4>One Additional Component of Citizenship</h4>
          <p>Cooperation: to work well with peers and other citizens, and follow rules/work with the rules to be a good citizen. - cooperation is important because a good citizen must be able to work with others politely, respectfully, and efficiently. A good citizen needs to be able to work together with other people on all sorts of projects. If a citizen is not able to work well with others, then they will not be considered a good citizen in many peoples' eyes.
      <h5>Personal Citizenship</h5>
        <p>An act of citizenship that I completed took place this summer. At my summer camp, I was a CIT, and part of my job was to help the food service staff do the dishes. That means that we did the dishes for all of camp every meal, for the whole summer. We did a great service to the community and were good citizens, because we helped to keep the camp running. Although our work in the kitchen went largely unnoticed, it was a powerful deed of citizenship to help out in the kitchen.
